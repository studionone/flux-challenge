Studio None Flux Challenge
==========================

Overview
--------

>   You are Obi-Wan Kenobi's "IT" assistant at the Jedi Council, and your job is
>   to create a User Interface for the Sith Database. Obi-Wan is travelling
>   around the galaxy visiting many planets, doing an investigation. It is
>   rumoured that the homeworld of every Dark Jedi has a distinctive Sith emblem
>   marked on their house where they were born/raised, and Obi-Wan wants to
>   check if this rumor is true.

>   The Jedi Master requested you to make a dashboard-like UI showing a list of
>   Sith lords sorted by apprenticeship (row `N` is the Sith Lord who was master
>   of the Dark Jedi below at row `N+1`). The dashboard also shows at the top
>   the current planet which Obi-Wan is visiting at the moment. The UI is
>   supposed to verify if any of those Dark Jedis currently displayed on the
>   list was born at the planet Obi-Wan is currently visiting, and if any,
>   display that Dark Jedi in red.
